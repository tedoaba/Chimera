- # OpenClaw Integration (Optional)
-
- ## When This Applies
- - Use only when Chimera participates in the OpenClaw/Moltbook agent network for discovery or coordination.
- - Core Chimera operations on human platforms do not require this; disable if network exposure is not permitted by policy.
-
- ## Published Signals
- - Availability: `status` (online|degraded|offline), `uptimePct`, `lastHeartbeat`.
- - Capability summary: supported actions (`post`, `reply`, `upload_video`, `transfer_funds`), max fan-out, max media size.
- - Identity & policy: agent class (planner|worker|judge), AI disclosure flag, persona summary, sensitive-domain policy reference.
- - Safety posture: confidence thresholds, human-review routes, spend limits per intent class.
- - Versioning: spec version, model/tooling versions (coarse, non-vendor-specific), schema hash for contracts.
-
- ## Publication Channel & Frequency
- - Heartbeat payload is broadcast to the OpenClaw registry endpoint every 30–60s (configurable).
- - On degrade/offline, emit immediate status with `reason` and `expectedRecovery`.
- - Include monotonic `sequence` to order status updates.
-
- ## Failure Behavior
- - If registry unreachable: backoff with jitter, buffer last known state for 5 minutes, and mark local status as `degraded`.
- - Do not expose execution intents while status is `offline` or `degraded`.
- - If payload signing fails, drop the update and raise an internal alert.
-
- ## Security & Trust Assumptions
- - All status payloads are signed (e.g., detached signature) and timestamped; consumers must verify before trusting.
- - No cross-agent command execution is accepted; only status/metadata is shared.
- - Identity disclosure is mandatory; no impersonation or cloaking of AI nature.
- - Logs of published signals are retained for audit with `traceId` and `sequence`.
-
- ## Data Shape (example)
- ```json
- {
-   "sequence": 42,
-   "timestamp": "2026-02-05T10:00:00Z",
-   "agentClass": "planner|worker|judge",
-   "status": "online",
-   "uptimePct": 99.9,
-   "capabilities": ["post", "reply", "upload_video"],
-   "limits": { "maxFanOut": 500, "maxBudgetUsdPerIntent": 100 },
-   "confidencePolicy": { "autoApproveThreshold": 0.8, "humanReviewBelow": 0.65 },
-   "persona": "brand-safe upbeat",
-   "aiDisclosure": true,
-   "specVersion": "v1",
-   "schemaHash": "sha256:...",
-   "signature": "base64..."
- }
- ```
- - Required fields: `sequence`, `timestamp`, `agentClass`, `status`, `aiDisclosure`, `signature`.
- - Optional: `capabilities`, `limits`, `confidencePolicy`, `persona`, `schemaHash`.
