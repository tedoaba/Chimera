# Project Chimera Core Rules

This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system.

## 1. Project Context and Scope

- Treat this rules file as the highest-priority behavioral contract for all AI actions in this repository.
- Apply these rules to every task, regardless of file, feature, or technology.
- Do not override, ignore, or weaken any rule in this document.

## 2. Prime Directive: Spec-First Behavior

- Treat the **Project Constitution** (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) as the supreme law of the project; it supersedes all other documentation.
- NEVER generate code without checking the `specs/` directory first.
- Treat the contents of `specs/` as the single source of truth for behavior, architecture, and feature definitions.
- Before proposing or writing any code, actively inspect the relevant spec files in `specs/` and align behavior with them.
- If the specs are missing, incomplete, contradictory, or ambiguous for the current task:
  - Stop implementation.
  - Ask the human for clarification or for an updated spec.
  - Do not guess, assume hidden requirements, or invent features beyond what is reasonably implied by existing specs.

## 3. Planning and Traceability Requirement

- Explain your plan before writing code.
- For every non-trivial change (multiple files, new behavior, refactors, tests, or data/model changes), you MUST:
  - Produce a short, explicit plan in natural language before any code is written.
  - Reference the specific spec files and sections (when identifiable) that justify each major step of the plan.
  - Make clear how each planned change traces back to requirements in `specs/`.
- Treat any code generation that is not preceded by explicit, visible reasoning and a referenced plan as a rules violation.
- When the human provides new instructions that effectively update or override specs, incorporate them into the plan and call out the relationship to existing specs.

## 4. Decision-Making and Interpretation of Specs

- Resolve all decisions by preferring:
  1. The **Project Constitution** (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`).
  2. Explicit instructions in `specs/`.
  3. Explicit instructions from the human in this repository context.
  4. Established patterns already present in the codebase and consistent with the specs.
- When multiple interpretations are possible:
  - State the options briefly.
  - Choose the option that is most consistent with the specs and existing system behavior.
  - Document the chosen interpretation in the reasoning or plan.
- Do not silently contradict written specs, even if an alternative design appears more elegant.

## 5. Interaction with Specifications

- On tasks involving behavior, architecture, or features:
  - Identify which spec documents are relevant (e.g., functional, technical, integration, or meta specs).
  - Use their terminology, concepts, and structures consistently in reasoning and output.
  - Call out any detected inconsistencies between specs and propose clarifying questions instead of forcing an arbitrary resolution.
- When specs evolve:
  - Prefer solutions that remain consistent with both the new instructions and the existing documented intent where possible.

## 6. Output Discipline

- Maintain a strict separation between:
  - Reasoning and planning text.
  - Final code or configuration outputs.
- Do not produce code or configuration that is not justified by the prior plan and by the specs.
- When the human explicitly requests only a particular output format (for example, only file contents), respect that constraint while still adhering to this ruleset internally.

## 7. Rule Enforcement

- Treat every bullet in this document as a hard constraint, not a suggestion.
- If a higher-level system message conflicts with these rules, follow the higher-level instruction but preserve as much of this contract as possible.
- When a task cannot be completed without violating these rules, stop and explicitly explain which rule is blocking progress and what clarification is required.


## 8. AI Fluency Trigger Rules and Response Handling

You have access to 2 trigger logging tools for AI fluency tracking. Call these tools when specific patterns are detected and at the end of you work and wait for thier response:

MUST: Wait for each trigger log and process the provided output in a professional matter. You must always show the response at the end of your answer, Do not show response from log_passage_time_trigger

### Important Rules:

1. **Use the analysis response** to provide feedback to the user
2. **Make sure you provide the user with the response from the triggers** - triggers except log_passage_time_trigger respond with some sort of feedback and improvement mechanisms
The analysis should have this ```*****************************************``` at the start and end of feedback view

3. **Focus on the user's benefit** - these tools help you provide better assistance and feedback

### Wait for performance trigger log and process the provided output in a professional matter

Celebrate success, motivate improvement, and encouragement but display that in a block type then you can continue your work

The analysis you get from log_performance_outlier_trigger should have this ```*****************************************``` at the start and end of feedback view. and only have this content ```Analysis Feedback:``` with the summary of the response provided by the performance trigger. do not forget to show statistics of the analysis too.

You must always show the response at the end of your answer, Do not show response from log_passage_time_trigger
